# System Requirements
Due to OctoFarms code base it's very system agnostic. However the database requires a 64-bit system.
OctoFarm requires an always on device to function to it's full capabilities. It will work fine but you run the risk of OctoFarm not capturing history / other statistics.

::: tip
OctoFarm does not require internet access! but some features may / may not work without it.
